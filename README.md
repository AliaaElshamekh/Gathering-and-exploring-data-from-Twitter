# Gathering-and-exploring-data-from-Twitter
In this project, we are going to study the rational behind some of hashtags (pro and against keywords) that are related to immigration topic. We have an initial 
manual classification for the tweets and we are going to discuss the steps used to preprocess the gathered data from ‘tweepy’ . 
These keywords hashtags are added to show that the tweet’s content is related to which side. We are going to make analyze the data make visualizations 
that will help to show the frequency of the keywords in the dataset. The findings are to be validated with what news says or what your real-life experiences tells us? 
How to make some conclusions about other keywords that are related to the immigrations topic which reflects users’ opinions.
